# Encryption_In_JS
A fun little project of making an encryption-decryption algorithm in js 



To use this code, you go to the main file and use 

Encryption.EncryptorRK for a one time pad encryption. if you wish to do so, leave the second parameter as null.
and
Encryption.EncryptionSK for a two key encryption

If you wish to use the RandomKey encryption, with a pregenerated random key, you can replace the null parameter with your key (preferably enclosed in  ` ` )

The Decryption process is a bit simpler, as it always requires a key.
